This folder contains an example of extraction of a unit cell (UC) from a SC (super cell) as snapshot 
from the MD (molecular dynamics). The case study is again NH4BH4 in cubic phase.

Generalyzation is straightforward.

The folder contains examples of the output generated: POSCAR_non-selective_0 (for ordinary relaxation) and
POSCAR_sel_0 -- the same POSCAR adapted for the selective dynamics.
